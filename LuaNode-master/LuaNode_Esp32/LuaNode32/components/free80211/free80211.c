/*
 * ieee80211_freedom_output returns -4 if value at addr [content of register a7] + 149 is 0.
 * So we need to find out which address [content of register a7] refers to and set that to 1.
 * Due to window shifting by 8, the contents of register a7 will most likely be in a15.
 * This address turns out to be &g_wifi_menuconfig - 0x253, propably some local variable?
 * I don't know why this works, but after setting this local variable to something other than 0,
 * outputting arbitrary 802.11 frames works fine.
 *
 * ieee80211_freedom_output also seems to read stuff from offsets starting at the address its first
 * parameter refers to, so we need to make sure this address is accessible. In order to make sure
 * other code doesn't interfere with ieee80211_freedom_output we just pass an array of zeros.
 * The first parameter is propably supposed to be a pointer to the wifi peripheral or config options,
 * but since we don't really know what ieee80211_freedom_output expects, we just use this workaround.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * buffer: Raw IEEE 802.11 packet to send, will be sent as-is, apart from bytes 24 - 31 which will be set to 0x00 in case buffer[0] is 0x80.
 * len: Length of IEEE 802.11 packet. Must be larger than 23 and smaller than or equal 0x578.
 *
 * Return values:
 * -3: Invalid packet length.
 * -2: Something is wrong with the frame header (the first two bytes) of the buffer.
 * -1: ??
 *  0: Everything worked fine.
