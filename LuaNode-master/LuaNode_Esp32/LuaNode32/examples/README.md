## EXAMPLES

The examples show you how to use LuaNode.

* **alexa_esp32**: An awesome application that using Amazon Echo Dot (voice control service) to turn on/off the 
		blue LED on DOIT ESP32 dev-board. Say "Alexa, turn on ESP" to Echo Dot to turn on the blue LED. 
		When she finish turning on the LED, she'll answer "OK". Say "Alexa, turn off ESP" to turn off 
		the LED. Have fun!
* **alexa_multi_esp32**: A sample to show you how to use Amazon Echo Dot to control more than two ESP32 device. You 
		can add as many ESP32 devices to be controlled as you wish.
* **wifi_scan**: Scan all APs around ESP32 device.
* **raw_flash_rw**: Read write ESP32 flash directly without file system.
* **simple_http_server**: Create a simple http server on ESP32. To test this 
			example, build it follow the next section, and then 
			connect to the AP established on ESP32 using your phone. 
			The AP named as `DOIT_XXXX`. When connect to ESP32 device, 
			open `192.168.4.1` on browser, you'll see a test page, 
			which echo `This is a test`, returned 
			from ESP32.
* **tcp_server_espconn**: A simple tcp server sample create with _espconn_. The server 
		listen port 11000. When client send data, the server will print the data.
* **tcp_client_espconn**: A tcp client create with _espconn_. To test this sample, make 
		sure the client and the server connected with the same network segment, 
		and the server listen the port 11000, than the server can receive data sent 
		from client.
* **dns_resolver**: A DNS resolver sample. To test this sample, connect your phone or 
		computer to ESP32 which run this sample, and then open any link in the browser.
		the return page will be a test page.
* **udp_server_espconn**: A udp server sample.
* **udp_broadcast**: A UDP broadcast sample create with _espconn_. In this sample, we create 
		a task to broadcast UDP message repeatedly. The remote port is set to 11000. 
		If you create a UDP server to listen the port, you'll receive the message sent from 
		ESP32 device. Don't forget to modified the macro EXAMPLE_WIFI_SSID and EXAMPLE_WIFI_PASS to 
		valid value.
* **telnet_server**: A simple telnet server sample. When you connect with ESP32 using telnet, and then 
		input command `hello`, it will echo `hello back`.
* **lwip_raw_api**: A RAW API sample. Show you how to use LwIP RAW API.
* **easy_mem**: A sample show you to use _easy_mem_, the memory manager.
* **bluetooth_scanner**: A sample show you how to scan BLE device. To test this sample, you 
		can use two ESP32 device, say A and B. A flashed the _ble_adv_ which is an example contained in _esp-idf_, 
		B flashed this sample. Then you can see B output the scan results, which list A. The other available 
		BLE device will be also listed in the results.
* **test_spiffs**: A test sample for SPIFFS.
* **camera**: A sample to show you how to use ESP32 to control a camera
* **lcd_nokia5110_driver**: A sample to show how to drive _Nokia5110_ LCD. The sample output some 
		characters to LCD.

* **ble_led_control**: A sample to show how to create BLE client and BLE server. In this sample, the 
		client send notify to server each 2 seconds. When the server receives the notification, 
		the server will turn on/off the blue LED on board according to the notification value. 
		To test this sample, you have to prepare two ESP32 dev-board.

* **esp32_nrf51822_ble_conn**: A sample to show how to create BLE connection between ESP32 and nRF51822 device. 
		The nRF51 device will be server and provide a characteristic for client to write data, the characteristic 
		UUID is `6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e`. ESP32 will act as client and connect to nRF51, 
		and then write "on"/"off" to the characteristic each 2 seconds. The nRF51 device will turn on/off 
		the LED on board according to the received string. You will see the LED on nRF51 device blink each 2 seconds.
* **ble_to_udp_server**: In this example, ESP32 scan BLE devices and then send the scan results to UDP server. User can 
		setup SSID, password, server IP and server port via uart. For more details, read the README doc in the 
		example's directory.

* **ble_notification**: An example to show how to send indication/notification between two ESP32 devices. The indication/notification
		is sent from `server` to `client`. Build the `server` and `client` within `ble_notification` folder, and then
		flash the generated firmware to two ESP32 respectively to test notifcation.

* **free80211send**: A sample to show how to send 80211 package. The 80211 component is from https://github.com/Jeija/esp32free80211

* **esp32_ble_gatt_server_led_control_for_phone**: A sample to show how to connect ESP32 with phone (including iOS & Android) 
		via BLE. Once connection established, you can controll LED on board via phone. Download the App here: https://github.com/Nicholas3388/LuaNode_BLE_Client

* **ota_tcp_update**: A sample to demostrate how to update firmware utilizing OTA via TCP server

* **json**: A sample to show how to use cJSON to encode/decode json string.

* **ds1307**: A sample show you how to use DS1307 (RTC module).

## HOW TO BUILD THE EXAMPLES

Copy the app_main.c within each example to the `main` folder within LuaNode32,
and then run `./build.sh` to build LuaNode.
